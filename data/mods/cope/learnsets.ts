/**
 * Describes a possible way to get a move onto a pokemon.
 *
 * First character is a generation number, 1-9.
 * Second character is a source ID, one of:
 *
 * - M = TM/HM
 * - T = tutor
 * - L = start or level-up, 3rd char+ is the level
 * - R = restricted (special moves like Rotom moves)
 * - E = egg
 * - D = Dream World, only 5D is valid
 * - S = event, 3rd char+ is the index in .eventData
 * - V = Virtual Console or Let's Go transfer, only 7V/8V is valid
 * - C = NOT A REAL SOURCE, see note, only 3C/4C is valid
 *
 * C marks certain moves learned by a pokemon's prevo. It's used to
 * work around the chainbreeding checker's shortcuts for performance;
 * it lets the pokemon be a valid father for teaching the move, but
 * is otherwise ignored by the learnset checker (which will actually
 * check prevos for compatibility).
